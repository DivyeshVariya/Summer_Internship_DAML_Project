Data Analytics & Machine Learning internship

Data Analytics is one of the most important and helpful factor for business growth. We can do analysis on any data using python libraries like numpy and pandas. Analyzed data can be visualized by matplotlib via various diagrams like pie chart, bar chart etc. Data Analysis is useful for decision making and machine learning model development. We will develop machine learning model using some data to predict important parameters and finds some useful insights. These insights driven that help us to take right decision according to the data. Build the machine learning model using various model building techniques like Linear Regression , Classification etc.
